Spiders

- Original Thoughts

A turned based, RPG game where players and enemies move in turns 
and the player has no immediate effect on the combat.
The player and the enemies will have at least health, attack, and defense attributes.
The player will be able to upgrade these attributes while the game progresses.
When an enemy and the player come close enough an automatic battle sequence will begin.


- Game Mechanics

The game right now is an early version of what I wanted to build.

Movement
The player can move on a 16x16 grid map and for every move of the player, each enemy does a random move.
The player can move around with the WASD keys.

Battle
If an enemy is on any neighbor tile of the player battle will begin.
When in battle the player and enemies cannot move and the player starts an attack.
The enemy will take damage equal to the players' attack minus his defense.
Then the enemy will attack and the battle will continue in a loop until the player or the enemy is dead.

score
The player can increase his score by collecting coins.
At the start of the game, there is a coin in a random location of the map.
When the player collects a coin another coin and a spider appear on a random location of the map.

Game Over
When the player loses all his health the game ends, your score is submitted and you go to the leaderboard screen.
If for any reason the submission fails then you will go back to the title screen.

- Future additions

Right now the attack and defense attributes are always the same and the player cannot change them in any way in the game.
In the future, I will try to add more attributes and items that increase those attributes.
The items will probably drop from the enemies or you will get a choice of an item every few coins you collect.
